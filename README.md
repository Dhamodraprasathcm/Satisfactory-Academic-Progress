Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is a set of academic performance standards that students must meet to maintain eligibility for certain benefits, such as financial aid or continued enrollment. Here's a brief overview of the key points related to SAP.
1. GPA Requirements
•	Minimum GPA: Students are usually required to maintain a minimum Grade Point Average (GPA). This standard ensures students are achieving at least a certain level of academic success.
2. Completion Rate
•	Pace of Progress: Students must complete a minimum percentage of the courses they attempt. Typically, this is around 67% of all attempted credits. This helps ensure students are moving towards graduation in a timely manner.
4. Maximum Time Frame
•	Credit Hour Limit: SAP policies often set a maximum time frame for completing a program, usually not exceeding 150% of the program’s length. For example, if a degree requires 120 credit hours, students may be allowed up to 180 credit hours to complete it.
5. Academic Standing
•	Good Standing: Students need to maintain good academic standing, which means not being on academic probation or facing academic dismissal due to poor performance.
6. Warning and Probation
•	SAP Warning: If students fail to meet SAP standards, they may be placed on SAP warning, allowing them to improve their performance in the following term without losing benefits.
•	SAP Probation: If they continue to fail SAP requirements, they might be put on probation, during which they must meet specific conditions to regain good standing.
7. Appeals Process
•	Appealing SAP Decisions: Students who fail to meet SAP standards due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., illness, family issues) may appeal the decision. If the appeal is successful, they might be placed on an academic plan to regain SAP compliance.
8. Regular Evaluation
•	Periodic Review: Institutions typically evaluate SAP at the end of each term, semester, or academic year to ensure students are on track.
Understanding and adhering to SAP standards is crucial for students to maintain their academic progress and stay eligible for benefits like financial aid.
